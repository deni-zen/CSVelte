# ROADMAP

To keep this project on track, I have included this road map file. It will
simply list the features I intend to implement for each version up until the
first production-ready release, v1.0. After that I'll probably create a new
roadmap document. There is also a wiki page with a more up-to-the-minute version
of the roadmap here: https://github.com/nozavroni/csvelte/wiki/Roadmap

## Version 0.1

See CHANGELOG File

## Version 0.2

Coming soon...
