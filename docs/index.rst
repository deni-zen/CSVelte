CSVelte
#######

CSVelte is a simple yet flexible CSV and tabular data library for PHP5.6+. It was written, originally, as a pseudo-port of Python's CSV module in early 2008. It was the result of the author's dissatisfaction with not only PHP's native CSV handling functions, but also with the lack of quality third-party PHP libraries for CSV and tabular data in general. Unfortunately, due to its author's personal and professional obligations, that original library (PHP CSV Utilities or PCU) was abandoned before it even reached API stability (the `last version was 0.3 <https://code.google.com/archive/p/php-csv-utils/>`_). Recently however, its author has had a bit of spare time and so decided to revive PCU, rewriting it from the ground up using modern PHP best practices and tools over a solid foundation of object-oriented design principles and re-introducing it to the world as CSVelte (pronounced just like the word `svelte <http://www.dictionary.com/browse/svelte>`_).
