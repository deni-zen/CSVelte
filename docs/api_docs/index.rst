    **Issue #85**

    * Need to customize and complete your fork of ``sphpdox/sphpdox`` so that you can auto-generate your API docs entirely within Sphinx
    * Write custom stylesheet to improve the pages produced by sphpdox library
    * Clean up the template being used by sphpdox library
    * Convert API docs for previous CSVelte versions from ApiGen to Sphinx
    * Once this is all implemented and API docs hosted on RTD, remove old API Docs

.. note::

   As I mentioned, the API documentation is automatically generated by a piece of software called `ApiGen`_. For this reason, it's currently hosted seperately from the rest of the documentation sections. I'm working on getting everything hosted together and you can expect that to happen before the v1.0 release.

You can find CSVelte's external API documentation at http://phpcsv.com/csvelte/apidocs/

    **Issue #111**

    In the mean time, while you're waiting for the sphpdox upgrade mentioned above...

        * Come up with a solution for hosting multiple versions of API docs
        * http://phpcsv.com/csvelte/apidocs/master should always point to most up-to-date docs
        * http://phpcsv.com/csvelte/apidocs/stable should always point to most recent stable version's docs
        * http://phpcsv.com/csvelte/apidocs/v0.1/master should always point to most up-to-date docs for the v0.1 release
        * Ideally you would have some way of redirecting using some program logic rather than having to duplicate api docs for /master, /stable, /v0.2/master, and /v0.2/stable, etc.
