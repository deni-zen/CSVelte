The user's guide is broken down into a series of chapters that walk you through CSVelte's features and concepts. Think of it like an instruction manual. It should be read more or less sequentially, as each chapter tends to build on knowledge from previous chapters. Throughout the user's guide you wlll find references and links to the :doc:`/api_docs/index`, which we'll get to next.
