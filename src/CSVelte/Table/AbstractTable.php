 * Although most of the time I'm going to want to use the BufferedTable class,
 * especially with large CSV files, I suppose there may be times when one may
 * want to use the standard Table class (which actually pulls the whole CSV data
 * set into memory). This class provides functionality shared between all types
 * of CSVelte\Table classes.
