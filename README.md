# CSVelte
A CSV reader/writer for PHP (pronounced like "svelte")

## Documentation/Home Page Coming Soon!
There will be a dedicated home page for my various projects at [luke.visinoni.net](http://luke.visinoni.net/) as soon as I get the time to throw it together...

This project started out as basically a PHP port of Python's CSV module, so you should be right at home if you're familiar with it.
