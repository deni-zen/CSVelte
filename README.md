## Getting Started

### Official Documentation

Head on over to the [documentation site](http://csvelte.phpcsv.com/) for instructions on reading and writing CSV files, auto-detecting CSV format, and more. You may also peruse the [API documentation](http://phpcsv.com/csvelte/apidocs/) for every class, interface, function and variable defined by CSVelte.

### Mailing List

For questions and in-depth discussion of CSVelte and CSV/tabular data in general, join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/csvelte-users).

## Contribute

CSVelte is a free (as in beer) library. I work on it in my spare time. If you like it, feel free to buy me a beer (you can PayPal me at luke.visinoni@gmail.com). Contributions will help me to keep pumping out new features and bug fixes and to, eventually, create a dedicated CSVelte website. Or, if you have an idea for a new feature or a bug report, feel free to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/nozavroni/csvelte/pulls).

## License

CSVelte is also free as in speach. It is licensed under the MIT license, which means you can do whatever you want with it so long as you understand that I'm not responsible for anything you do with it and you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source. Enjoy!

## About the author

CSVelte was designed and developed by [Luke Visinoni](https://github.com/nozavroni). Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:luke.visinoni@gmail.com) if you want to tell me how great it is or even if you want to tell me it's an abomination and that I should be shot. I'd love to hear from you either way!

## Credits and Special Thanks

I would just like to thank PÃ¡draic Brady and anybody else working on the Mockery library for their extremely clean and elegant Github/Travis-CI/Scrutinizer/Coveralls/etc. integration code. Without it, this library would have taken much longer to see its first release. And although I tried to simply take inspiration from it, I found it hard not to simply copy what they did. But as they say, [imitation is the sincerest form of flattery](https://books.google.com/books?id=6AclAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false).

I would also like to thank the small, tight-knit community of developers at the <a href="http://devnetwork.net/">PHP Developer's Network Forums</a>. I honestly don't know where I'd be without those guys. They taught me everything I know.

Finally, I'd like to thank both the members of the [CSV on the Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page) as well as the authors of [Python PEP #305](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0305/), which was actually the inspiration for the first permutation of this library (PHP CSV Utilities) almost a decade ago.
