# CSVelte
A CSV reader/writer for PHP (pronounced like "svelte") with automatic format detection (tabs or commas? \n or \r\n? double or single quote? quote all fields or just the ones with special characters? etc.)

This is the official successor to my old Google Code project, [php-csv-utils](https://code.google.com/archive/p/php-csv-utils/).

## Documentation/Home Page Coming Soon!
There will be a dedicated home page for my various projects at [luke.visinoni.net](http://luke.visinoni.net/) as soon as I get the time to throw it together...

This project started out as basically a PHP port of Python's CSV module, so you should be right at home if you're familiar with it.
