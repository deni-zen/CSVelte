CSVelte (pronounced "svelte") aims to be an elegant, object-oriented PHP5.3+ library with an intuitive interface. My aim is to comply with as much of the [_CSV on the Web_ Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page)'s specifications and recommendations as possible. 

This is the official successor to my old Google Code project, [php-csv-utils](https://code.google.com/archive/p/php-csv-utils/), which was basically a direct port of python's CSV module (see [CSV Python Enhancement Proposal](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) and [CSV File API](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0305/)).

## Documentation/Home Page Coming Soon!
There will be a dedicated home page for my various projects at https://deni-zen.github.io/csvelte/ as soon as I get the time to throw it together...
