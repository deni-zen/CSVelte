/**
 * Testing new Input/Output classes for v0.2.
 *
 * Version 0.2 intends to refactor how CSVelte deails with I/O to make it neater,
 * cleaner, more intuitive, etc. It intends to use the SplFileObject and its ilk.
 * This will test all the new shit. Will most likely replace the following:
 *
 *     * InputStringTest
 *     * InputTest
 *     * WritableTest
 *
 * It will also most likely effect many of the tests and code in the following:
 *
 *     * CSVelteTest
 *     * ReaderTest
 *     * TasterTest
 *     * TestFiles
 *     * WriterTest
 *
 * Also will likely require quite a bit of refactoring in the reader, writer,
 * and the taster. And probably the factory/facade as well.
